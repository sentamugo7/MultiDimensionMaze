This is a (up to) six dimensional maze. There are three visual dimensions -  
     x (cyan), y (magenta), z (yellow), and three unseen dimensions -  
     u (red), v (green), w (blue).

     the upper right. The icon will be white if there is a path in that direction,<br/>
     otherwise black.<br/>
If there is a pathway in an unseen dimension, there will be a plus and/or<br/>
     minus sign in front of you in the color of that dimension. To move in that<br/>
